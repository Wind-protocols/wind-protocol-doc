## Build scalable and modulated web3 ecosytem 
By bread.sol

3/27/2022 

At the kernel level web2 super-app and web3 super-app are different(There are no web3 super-app in practice yet). Interestingly web3's data and account systems are more homogeneous and unified. This aspects of blockchain largely increased the composiblity between datas and different level of encrypted service. In the web3 decentralized world with nfts, internet has re-define the concept of ownership and user-profile. 

 The rising of NFTs made the web3 Dapps starting to look a lot more like their web2 counterpart. They are rushing to define user's identity and profile space with their terms. Bonfida done a rather good job among the crowed. User can upload a external link or a NFT that's in the same wallet as their Solana domain service account(domain?). 

Wind has a rather complex set up currently, the architecture at design are flawed. It's still fragmented and user-unfriendly.
There are not many example that wind can learn from. Since Wind's core identity it's surrounded the avatars, not the owners/users. The user experience are defined in a complete web3 way.

Wind define their user identity by their 
+ Their avatar inside the metaverse  
+ Their role inside the DAO  
+ Their transactional on-chain profile 

The V1 protocol are separated and scattered through many different frontends. The on-chain part are delegated to Wind metaverse website, Wind protocol website and wind metaverse PC. Now with the upcoming EGO, Cloud portal, Palace-marketplace and governance portal, Wind's core it's suffering massively and fatigue of keeping each of them talking to each other and information up to date. Instead of a modulated ecosystem we have to update them manually 1 by 1. Inefficient and unneccessary. 

How can we leverage blockchain and modulated software engineering to solve such issue? 

## Unofficial Wind protocol V2 proposal: 
#### core port: the front end link to all Modulated functions. 
#### modules
#### ledgers: Solana and potentially other blockchain
