## EgoğŸŸ¡ã€€

ã€€EGO is the virtualization of desire, ego existed in a rather static form yet running in perpetual motion and fragmented. What stands out about the EGO-tier avatar is not its relevance to the Wind protocol or its possibility as a network companion, it emphasizes the unique ability to interact with Es class assets, ownership of their metadata, and the ability to generate other classes of assets.
