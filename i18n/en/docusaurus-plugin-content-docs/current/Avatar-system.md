## The relationship between the ES and Windmetaverse

ES is the most common token for participating in the Windmetaverse. Your ES in the Windmetaverse is completely independent of the physical world. The E can enrich your experience in various forms. Wind hopes to make Windmetaverse more realistically reflect the limited freedom consciousness of the real world.

## The background setting of the avatar

When you come to the Central Plains, you still have no right to determine the inherent history/data of your avatar in the Central Plains world. The age, lineage, and even names of all the avatar of Genesis of windmetaverse have been determined by oracle. However, it is interesting that the same is true of human civilization in our physical universe. Infants have no power to choose. Every human being is like an incarnation, and the will/soul enters the incarnation of the physical world without the power of choice. For those who participated in the creation of the windmetaverse, the greatest freedom is nothing more than finding a favorite avatar in a pseudo-random way to participate in the metaverse.



## maturation and reproduction
The ES will gradually mature and decay over time. This process cannot be reversed or changed. If your avatar is over 20 years old, you can breed with different avatars. The offspring will not be on the chain until the age of 18, and it will exist in the WIND oracle as NPC data. It will be in the WIND oracle, once reaching age, the avatar will become a playable character and has a 50% chance of appearing in either the mother or father's address. Either way, for a mature avatar to acquire limited will, a real human being is required to interact with it.

The ES as a kind of on-chain matter/avatar is wind reference to the physical society of humans and based on our time and matter. My DNA metadata is determined based on its parental metadata. The dominant bloodline of the offspring will be determined according to the bloodline of the woman, and the name of the child will be determined by the free will/metadata of the incarnation, so as to preserve the particularity of this metaverse and the physical and social distance to the greatest extent. At the same time, when the avatar is under the age of 18, the avatar's data will only exist on the oracle machine of the wind in the metaverse, and will not become a controllable on-chain asset. After the incarnation turns 18, their souls can be uploaded to the Wind Spirit Temple by their parents to find the incarnation's soul.
