Different virtual identities over the age of 20 can produce offspring from each other. 

The offspring will not be on the chain until the age of 18, and it will exist as NPC data in the WIND oracle. It will be in the WIND Oracle system. Once it reaches the age, the avatar will become a playable character, and there is a 50% chance that it will appear in the address of the mother or father. In any case, for a mature avatar to obtain limited free will, it needs a real person to interact with it.
