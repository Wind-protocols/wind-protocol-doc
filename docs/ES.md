## Es inside the Wind Metaverse 

Es is the most common token for participating in the Wind universe. Your identity in the Wind metaverse is completely independent of the physical world. The Es can enrich your experience in various forms. Wind hopes to Es can realistically reflect the limited freedom consciousness of the real world.


## Philosophy
Combustibles created to satisfy one's instinctual desires. Note that ES series avatars will not be limited to human-based avatars, but also assets.

## Setting

When you come to Wind metaverse, you still have no right to decide the inherent history/data of your incarnation. The ages, bloodlines, and even names of all incarnations have been determined by wind's oracle. Interestingly however, the same is true of human civilization in our physical universe, babies have no power of choice, every human being is like an incarnation, and the will/soul enters the incarnation of the physical world with no power of choice. For those who participated in the creation of the Wind Metaverse, the greatest freedom is nothing more than finding a favorite avatar in a pseudo-random way to participate in the metaverse of the incarnations.
