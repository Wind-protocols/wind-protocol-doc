## SOC
Solcrystol (SOC) is an experimental token used to unlock the Wind Protocol Avatar-pool. Essentially, it has 0 financial value and is distributed only with venues used to improve the community. <br />
Future usage scenarios include, but are not limited to, governance wind tunnels, Palace-Marketplace, and minting usage of avatar pools. <br />
The minting rights and management rights of SOC will be gradually transferred to the artificial intelligence of Air Duo and Feng. <br />
